## Description

The Task Management dApp is a decentralized application built on the Stellar blockchain using ReactJS and Solidity. It enables users to create, assign, track, and complete tasks securely and transparently. Utilizing Web3 technology, the dApp ensures that all task data is stored on-chain, preventing tampering or loss. Users can set deadlines, update statuses, and verify completed work through smart contracts. The platform enhances collaboration by allowing multiple users to interact seamlessly while maintaining decentralization. By integrating Stellarâ€™s fast and low-cost transactions, the dApp ensures efficiency and accessibility. This project aims to provide a trustless, secure, and transparent task management solution for individuals and teams in a blockchain-powered ecosystem.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize task management by creating a decentralized platform that empowers users with transparency, security, and full ownership of their data. Built with ReactJS and Solidity on the Stellar blockchain, our dApp ensures trustless collaboration, allowing individuals and teams worldwide to create, assign, and track tasks seamlessly. By leveraging blockchain technology, we eliminate central authority control, ensuring immutable records and enhanced security. This project will transform productivity by fostering accountability, reducing fraud, and enabling seamless remote teamwork. We aim to set a new standard for decentralized task management, making work more efficient, fair, and accessible for everyone.
